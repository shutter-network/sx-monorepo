"""Shared crypto helpers for the automated keyper bearer-token bootstrap.

See docs/private-voting/keyper-token-bootstrap.md for the full design. Used
by both ``keyper.py`` (unseal + verify + install) and ``dkg_coordinator.py``
(verify keyper encryption keys, mint + seal + sign + push tokens).

Two independent properties, neither substituting for the other:
  - confidentiality: ``x25519_seal``/``x25519_unseal`` (anonymous sealed
    box -- anyone can seal *to* a public key, so this alone proves nothing
    about the sender)
  - authenticity: an EIP-191 signature over the plaintext payload, computed
    with ``payload_hash``/``enc_pubkey_hash`` and verified by the caller
    against a known address (``COORDINATOR_ADDRESS`` or a keyper's own
    signing address)
